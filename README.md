## Description & Objectives
Exploratory data analysis of the popularity of songs derived from the last 7 decades (1950 - 2010) with various regression and classification problems. 

## Source
The original source of the data is derived from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/spotify-past-decades-songs-50s10s) kaggle repository created by [N. Carbone](https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92).

## Purpose

The data was modified (e.g. merging and cleaning the CSV files provided) in such a way for the construction of a class competition at Strathclyde University in the module of CS985 Machine Learning (academic year 2019-20), leading to two problems: 
1) [Regression problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs98x-spotify-regression/overview)
2) [Classification problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs98xspotifyclassification)

The aim was the identification of the most important attributes that the most popular songs share and have in common.

In the [regression problem](https://github.com/dimi-fn/Spotify-Songs/tree/master/Spotify_Songs_Popularity_Regression), various models were built in order to predict the popularity of the songs, whereas the [classification problem](https://github.com/dimi-fn/Spotify-Songs/tree/master/Spotify_Songs_Genres_Classification) led to the construction of models that predicted their music genre.
