# Spotify-Songs

## Description & Objectives
A data analysis of the popularity of songs derived from the last 7 decades (1950 - 2010) with various regression and classification problems. 

The aim was the identification of the most important attributes that the most popular songs share and have in common.

## Source:
The original source of the data comes from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/spotify-past-decades-songs-50s10s) kaggle repository. Consequently, this data was modified (e.g. merging the csv files provided) in such a way for the construction of a class competition at Strathclyde University in the module of Machine Learning, leading to two problems: 
1) [Regression problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs98x-spotify-regression/overview)
2) [Classification problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs98xspotifyclassification)
